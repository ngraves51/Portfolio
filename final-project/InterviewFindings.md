# Interview Findings

These are the interview findings I gathered from the questions that I asked my sample group.
 

Question | Female, Architect, mid 20s | Female, Journalist, early 30s | Male, Software Engineer, mid 40s
---------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------
Could you please tell me what you think this webpage is for?| Teaching people how to be aware and check their credit, and shining light on the issue of how people arne't aware of errors in their credit. | To inform Americans about the dangers of like false credit reporting and what they can perhaps do to avoid that. | It was for talking about the credit reporting and how there's been a lot of issues with it lately and a lot of people have errors come up on their credit report as a result of faulty reporting.
Who do you think is the intended audience? | People who aren't on top of their credit. | First time credit cards or loan applicants, people who are trying to estabish credit. | Consumers, mainly people I would say over 18, I'd say probably between 18 and 40. I was going a bit broad, but for the younger spectrum, people looking to make the larger purchase in their life that may not know as much about credit reporting.
How did you feel after viewing the webpage? | I learned things about credit that I didn't know before. So I felt more knowledgeable, but I guess it is a bit concerning what is happening with credit system. |  I feel like credit agencies need to have a better system so that errors don't occur like this. | I would say that it was not as surprising I think as many people probably think, given my background on the thing. Since I I know credit reporting issues have been around for a while. However, I do think it's unfortunate that a lot more issues have been coming up. Due to a various amount of reasons but I think one, because the enforcement leniency due to the pandemic.
Do you have any questions about anything presented? Was there anything that you found confusing? | Not really, no. | How do these errors occur like how does a wrong, a home address, get listed, is that because of a mistake the applicant made or something that was messed up in the system or something that was set up by fraud? | One thing I found confusing is one of like the suggestions they made up here to just make sure Americans have the right to a credit report. I'm pretty sure that's already a right that everybody has though. You're entitled to receive a free credit report directly from the credit bureaus, I believe twice a year that you're allowed to pull that has no effect on your credit. So I thought that was kind of confusing because they kind of made it seem as like a suggestion, even though that already exists.
Is there anything that you would change? | No, I think that the content was fine overall. | No, I don't think anything is that bad. Maybe just clairify what credit reporting errors are. | I think they should have put like a little bit of information about credit to I think it spoke a lot about like, there's a lot of credit reporting issues, maybe speak about like the specific types of issues that come about, like for example is that usually collections that come as issues or is it like loans that people take out? I feel like that would mean more to me as a consumer.
