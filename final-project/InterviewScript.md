# Interview Script

This is the interview script that I utilized when conducting my user research.

## Introduction

Brief introduction - Share your name and explain your role as a graduate student.

Discuss the purpose of the interview. " My goal today is to get feedback on a project that I have made for a data visualization class. I am talking to people to get an idea for how to improve my presentation and make my story clearer. All feedback is anonymous and this should only take about 5 or 10 minutes. Please feel free to give honest answers, and constructive critisism is encouraged."

## Main Section

"I have a draft of the webpage that I have been designing to present my project. Please lookover it and make a note next to anything that is confusing or redundant. Once you are done, I have a few questions for you and we can talk about any notes that you may have taken. Oh, and I will make sure to answer any questions that you have. "

"Please let me know when you are done reading and ready for my follow-up questions."

1.  "Could you please tell me what you think this webpage is for?"
2.  "Who do you think is the intended audience?"
3.  "How did you feel after viewing the webpage?"
4.  "Do you have any questions about anything presented? Was there anything that you found confusing?"
5.  "Is there anything that you would change?"


## Wrap-Up

"Thank you so much for your help and your time. Do you have any questions for me at this time?"
