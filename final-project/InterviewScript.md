# Interview Script

This is the interview script that I utilized when conducting my user research.

## Introduction

Brief introduction - Share your name and explain your role as a graduate student.

Discuss the purpose of the interview. " My goal today is to get feedback on a project that I have made for a data visualization class. I am talking to people to get an idea for how to improve my presentation and make my story clearer. All feedback is anonymous and this should only take about 5 or 10 minutes."
