# Final Project: Part 3

Welcome to Part 3 of my Final Project. This is the final part where I wrapped everything together. Please see Parts 1 and 2 to see the work I did leading up to this finale.

## Updates from Part 2


Overall, in Part 2 I build a fairly complete draft to use as my final deliverable. I took the user research feedback I received, and I focused on implementing the insights that I learned from the interviews. 

First, I wanted to clear up some confusion I witnessed about credit reporting errors by providing some more background information. I added a few sentences to the second slide section that explained what credit reporting errors are and why they occur. I also added a sentence about why credit reports matter and how they impact auto loans, mortgages, and even jobs. Additionally, I added some information about common credit report errors  (a suggestion from the user research). I was unable to find conclusive data on the occurrences of specific credit reporting errors. However, in the fourth slide section, I added more types of common errors for consumers to look out for, and I linked to a resource web page published by the CFPB that listed many credit reporting errors for consumers to look out for. 

Next, I went through the entire presentation and checked it for grammar and flow. I edited some of the text that I wrote that accompanies my data visualizations. I also added section titles for my data visualizations to help break them up into more digestible chunks. I also created formal citations for all of my references at this point. 

Then, I worked a bit on fine-tuning some of the visual aspects of my shorthand presentation. Specifically, on the second slide section, I realize that with the "text over media," the white text can sometimes blend in with the background a bit. I experimented with black text and a "light" background, but I felt like this detracted from the overall mood of the presentation. Therefore, I went back to the "dark background" with light text, and I increased the background image overlay to make it as dark as possible so that the text would stand out more. I also set the text to "fade in" so that the white text would show up in a darker section of the background picture. I realize that it still is not perfect, but if you compare it to the draft version, I think there is a noticeable improvement. 

Finally, I worked more on polishing the "Credit Reporting Error Complaints Over Last Decade" visualization. Even though the same visualization shows up in Part 1, I have actually edited this in Flourish during Part 1, 2, and 3; however, I used the same embedded image so Flourish only displays the final visualization. In part 1, I just had the blue line only. However, I thought it looked a bit off with only having part of the 2021 data. I thought about removing the 2021 data overall because it did not fit in well with all of the "full years" of data points ahead of it. In part 2, I utilized some statistics software to develop projections for the total number of credit reporting error complaints for all of 2021. I then wanted to include this information because it provided excellent context for that visualization, especially in comparison to 2020. I used a dotted line to show the projection and spent a while trying to find a way to get the x-axis to accommodate two half-year ticks for 2021. I could not find a great way to do this, so I decided to revisit it in part 3. In part 3, I tried changing the "label" and "tickmark" settings, although, despite constant tinkering, I could not get it to work as I wanted it to. Therefore, I ended up adding a note to provide context for the red "total for 2021" dotted line. This is perhaps the blemish on my presentation that I am most self-conscious of. However, when I asked my user research sample about the visualization again, they all said they thought the caption note was enough. If I went through one final revision, I would build a better-scaled version of the visualization in Tableau.

## Audience

The audience I identified for my final deliverable did not change very much from Part 2 of the Final Project. I would say the target audience is: People living in the United States of America, with or without a credit history and at least an average degree of education (High School Graduate). Preferably between 18 and 45 years of age, who have an interest in personal finance or consumer finance. The main changes are that I hope to target both people living in America with or without credit histories, because I hope that this can be helpful to both groups. Those with credit histories because they should be checking their credit reports to check for errors. Those without credit histories because they may not be aware that they do not have a credit history, and the only way that they could know is by checking. Finally, I lowered the target age after a discussion with one of my user research subjects. I agreed with them that younger people probably need to care about their credit more because they will be more likely to make large purchases that require credit (cars, houses, etc). However, I would hope that older individuals would also find my presentation engaging.
