# Final Project: Part 2

## Final Project Storyboards and User research

Welcome to Part 2 of my Final Project. Here I have completed a rough draft of my final project, and conducted user research to help me refine my storytelling and data visualization skills. I have chosen to utilize ShortHand to build the storyboard for my project and I carried over the data visualizations I made in Part 1.
Please feel free to check my progress and view this initial draft!
