# Final Project: Part 2

## Final Project Storyboards and User research

Welcome to Part 2 of my Final Project. Here I have completed a rough draft of my final project and conducted user research to help me refine my storytelling and data visualization skills. I have chosen to utilize ShortHand to build the storyboard for my project, and I carried over the data visualizations I made in Part 1.
Please feel free to check my progress and view this initial draft!

## User Research and Interviews
I collected a sample of 3 people to view the draft of my final project with the purpose of conducting user research. 

## User Research Protocol

**Target Audience**

Audience | Description
---------|------------
Target Audience | People living in the United States of America, with a credit history and at least an average degree of education (High School Graduate). Preferably between 18 and 55 years of age, who have an interest in personal finance. 
Sample | This sample was limited to 3 Americans of different ages: a female architect in mid 20s, a female journalist in early 30s, and a male software engineer in mid 40s. All of them have some knowledge about the US Credit Reporting System and data visualizations. All of them have at least a Bachelor's degree. I approached these individuals to interview because they fit the target audience criteria, and they were readily available.

## Planned Changes from User Research
Overall, the user research interviews were very helpful. It seemed that, as a whole, the shorthand webpage seemed to be an effective medium for presenting the project. I think that I need to include a bit more background information about what credit reporting errors are and how they happen. I can see from my user research that I had seemed to have assumed such background knowledge for my shorthand presentation. Additionally, I will try to find more information about the types of credit reporting errors that are more common, so that the audience can know what to be looking for in their credit reports. Finally, I will try to add more headings to the paragraphs that I had prepared to make them more digestible.
