# Final Project: Part 1

## Project Outline
I have decided to focus on using data visualizations to show how credit reporting errors have been become a growing problem over the last decade. Furthermore, I wish to highlight how credit reporting errors have exploded throughout the course of the pandemic, and illustrate how this is an ongoing problem that still affects many Americans even throughout our pandemic recovery. My goal is to bring awareness to this issue that affects all Americans, and inspire the audience to contact their local congressional representatives and demand policy reform to address this growing outbreak that hinders our fellow Americans' financial stability. 

I decided to focus on credit reporting errors for this project as I saw the impact that credit can have on people's financial wellbeing while working with the homeless community. Credit reporting errors can hinder someone from taking out a new mortgage or autoloan, and if granted can cause the loan to be adminisered under less favorable terms. The number of credit reporting complaints have increased every year since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) began tracking them in 2012. While the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database website does a great job presenting the information about the rise in these credit reporting complaints, I hope to present the data in a slightly different way to help the audience contextualize the information by putting it into perspective. Furthermore, the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database asks the user to put in search criteria in order to present the designated data information and trends, with my data visualizations I hope to hone in on key data points that can help viewers understand the data without having to know what to "search for" on the CFPB complaint database. In addition, I will cover race and ethnicity data from the CFPB people who are "credit invisible" and "credit unscoreable".


##  Story Arc

* __Set Up__

Over the last decade, credit reporting error complaints have skyrocketed, setting thousands of Americans' financial wellbeing at risk. 
* __Conflict__

Many Americans view the credit reporting system as a fair and balanced way to gain access to the credit system in the United States. People believe that that if they pay off their bills as scheduled and on time, then they will generally get good credit scores. However, CFPB data from the last decade, and 2020 in particular, show that erroneous practices within credit reporting have plagued more Americans every year. The pandemic caused a spike in credit reporting errors that affected many Americans who likely throught that the credit reporting system was fair and just. This rise in credit reporting errors is spurred by credit bureau practices that prioritze selling more financial data overall, rather than more accurate data. 

* __Data and Trends__

[The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that one in five Americans have an error on their credit report](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/02/ftc-study-five-percent-consumers-had-errors-their-credit-reports) which can lead to less favorable loan terms, higher interest rates, or denial of credit.
However, the FTC reported that statistic in 2013, when the overall number of credit reporting complaints was 19 times less then the number of credit reporting clamplaints logged in 2020. Here, I will use [data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) to highlight the growing trends in consumer credit reporting complaints over the last few years, as well focusing on credit reporting complaints during 2020 compared to other CFPB complaint types. 
Finally, I will present data visualizations that illustrate [CFPB race and ethnicity data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-point-credit-invisibles/) that show increased likelyhood for people of minority groups to be erroneously made "credit insvisible" or credit unscoreable" due to exisiting racial disparities in credit reporting. 

* __Resolution__
This final project will conclude by introducing both practical measures for individual Americans to take to mitigate credit reporting errors, as well as broader policy recommendations that policy makers should consider to reduce this growing epidemic of credit reporting errors. My overall goal is to raise awareness about the propensity of credit reporting errors and to motivate the public to take action to advocate for themselves.
