# Final Project: Part 1

## Project Outline
I have decided to focus on using data visualizations to show how credit reporting errors have been become a growing problem over the last decade. Furthermore, I wish to highlight how credit reporting errors have exploded throughout the course of the pandemic, and illustrate how this is an ongoing problem that still affects many Americans even throughout our pandemic recovery. My goal is to bring awareness to this issue that affects all Americans, and inspire the audience to contact their local congressional representatives and demand policy reform to address this growing outbreak that hinders our fellow Americans' financial stability.
