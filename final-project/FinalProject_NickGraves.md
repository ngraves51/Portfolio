# Final Project: Part 1

## Project Outline
I have decided to focus on using data visualizations to show how credit reporting errors have become a growing problem over the last decade. Furthermore, I wish to highlight how credit reporting errors have exploded throughout the pandemic and illustrate how this is an ongoing problem that still affects many Americans even throughout our pandemic recovery. My goal is to bring awareness to this issue that affects all Americans, and inspire the audience to contact their local congressional representatives and demand policy reform to address this growing outbreak that hinders our fellow Americans’ financial stability.
I decided to focus on credit reporting errors for this project as I saw the impact that credit can have on people’s financial wellbeing while working with the homeless community. Credit reporting errors can hinder someone from taking out a new mortgage or auto loan, and if granted, can cause the loan to be administered under less favorable terms. The number of credit reporting complaints has increased every year since the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) began tracking them in 2012. While the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database website does a great job presenting the information about the rise in these credit reporting complaints, I hope to present the data in a slightly different way to help the audience contextualize the information by putting it into perspective. Furthermore, the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database asks the user to put in search criteria in order to present the designated data information and trends; with my data visualizations, I hope to hone in on key data points that can help viewers understand the data without having to know what to “search for” on the CFPB complaint database. In addition, I will cover race and ethnicity data from the CFPB people who are “credit invisible” and “credit unscorable.”


##  Story Arc

* __Set Up__

Over the last decade, credit reporting error complaints have skyrocketed, setting thousands of Americans' financial well-being at risk. 
* __Conflict__

Many Americans view the credit reporting system as a fair and balanced way to gain access to the credit system in the United States. People believe that if they pay off their bills as scheduled and on time, they will generally get good credit scores. However, CFPB data from the last decade, and 2020 in particular, show that erroneous practices within credit reporting have plagued more Americans every year. The pandemic caused a spike in credit reporting errors that affected many Americans who likely thought that the credit reporting system was fair and just. This rise in credit reporting errors is spurred by credit bureau practices that prioritize selling more financial data overall, rather than more accurate data.

* __Data and Trends__

[The Federal Trade Commission has estimated that one in five Americans have an error on their credit report](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/02/ftc-study-five-percent-consumers-had-errors-their-credit-reports), which can lead to less favorable loan terms, higher interest rates, or denial of credit.
However, the FTC reported that statistic in 2013, when the overall number of credit reporting complaints was 19 times less then the number of credit reporting complaints logged in 2020. Here, I will use [data from the CFPB Consumer Complaint Database](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/consumer-complaints/) to highlight the growing trends in consumer credit reporting complaints over the last few years, as well as focusing on credit reporting complaints during 2020 compared to other CFPB complaint types. 
Finally, I will present data visualizations that illustrate [CFPB race and ethnicity data](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/research-reports/data-point-credit-invisibles/) that show the increased likelihood for people of minority groups to be erroneously made "credit insvisible" or credit unscorable" due to existing racial disparities in credit reporting. 

* __Resolution__
This final project will conclude by introducing both practical measures for individual Americans to take to mitigate credit reporting errors, as well as broader policy recommendations that policymakers should consider to reduce this growing epidemic of credit reporting errors. My overall goal is to raise awareness about the propensity of credit reporting errors and to motivate the public to take action to advocate for themselves.


# Initial Sketches and Wireframes
This is an initial sketch to highlight one of the key takeaways that I hope for the audience to grasp. That credit reporting errors affect more than most would expect. I like that this visualization is intuitive and does not need to be complicated to make the point. Also, one other point, this represents the number of Americans that have an error on their credit report, not the number of Americans that KNOW they have an error on their credit report.

Here are some initial wireframes that I will refine to develop my data visualizations. First, I have a simple line graph that shows the rise in credit report complaints over the last decade. I like that it is easy to understand and gets the point across, but I may add a few things in future revisions. For example, I may add another layer, such as mortgage complaints. This would show a rise in credit reporting complaints and a fall in mortgage complaints over the last ten years. Additionally, I am not quite sure about what to do with 2021 data. I think that it should be included, as this data is important. Although it is also not a complete year, the chart makes it look like the number of complaints dropped sharply after 2020. I will conduct user research on this component to see what others may think.

Here I looked at different types of consumer complaints in 2020. I used a stacked area chart to emphasize the total amount of complaints as well as their proportions. I think that it demonstrates the comparative weight of the credit reporting complaints well. Although, perhaps a bit too much as all the blue is a bit 'all-encompassing'. I am also interested in seeing what insights user research will show me here.

This final visualization looks at CFPB race and ethnicity data that shows the increased likelihood for people of minority groups to be erroneously made "credit unscorable" due to existing racial disparities in credit reporting. I experimented a few different ways, and I used a simple bar chart to focus on the total unscored percentage. There are a few different ways that I can do this, so this may change in my final version. I did not want to get too much into the weeds about "credit unscored" vs. "credit invisible." However, I may need to enhance this chart a bit and give a more full view of the disparity.

## Methods and Mediums
To develop this final project, I will complete user research to gather feedback on my wireframes and data visualizations.  I will likely go to my friends, family, and colleagues as they all have varying knowledge on credit reporting and should represent a diverse enough sample. Then I will use this feedback to refine my visualizations and build storyboards that will help me organize my final product. I plan to use Shorthand to showcase my data visualizations and written text. Additionally, I will continue to use Flourish, and I may explore Infogram as I continue to develop my data visualizations.
