# About me
Hello! I'm a student in the Telling Stories with Data course.
My name is Nick Graves and my pronouns are he, him, and his.
I am in the Master of Science in Public Policy & Management Program at Carnegie Mellon University.
I chose this program to refine my policy analysis and data analytics by learning new skills, such as data visualization.
After I complete my graduate degree, I plan to work for the federal government as an analyst.

# What I hope to learn 
I hope to learn how to better craft data visualizations through more thoughtful chart and graph designs.
I also hope to learn how to better utilize different technology mediums that allow me to organize data (such as Tableau Software) and display my work (such as GitHub).

Here's where all of my cool data visualizations will go!
Check back soon to see my completed projects!
