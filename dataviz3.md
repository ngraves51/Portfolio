# Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design

I decided to redesign a few of the data visualizations in the FBI's 2018 Internet Crime Report.
I think that many federal agencies do a great job of gathering data on topics that benefit the public interest, such a data on internet crimes.
However, sometimes this data is not presented in the most accessible manner for the audience.
In the 2018 Internet Crime Report, plenty of demographic data related to internet crimes is presented accurately, however much of this data is presented in data tables.
Therefore, I redesigned a data table into a more intuitive data visualization and I also redesigned a few of the charts presented in the report.

# Original Data Visualizations and Data Tables in the FBI's 2018 Internet Crime Report.

Overall, this chart gets the job done acceptable. However, I chose to redesign it because I thought that due to the wide range on the Y-axis, it seemed difficult to tell the relative difference in height between some of the middle bars.

This is a data table that gets the information across, but looks a bit bland. I thought that a proper data visualization would do a better job of displaying the proportions associated with these age ranges.

This is one of my favorite visualizations in the report because it gives a great visual representation of internet crimes across the US. That said, I think that leaving the majority of the States blank can potentially send the wrong message. At first glance, people may think that the blank States have no reports on internet crime at all. 


#  Wireframes and Initial Feedback on Redesigns

## Viz 1
Here I chose to redesign the first chart as a line graph, as I think this shows changes in trends over time a bit better. Additionally, I greatly reduced the range on the Y axis to make the differences between the years stand out a bit more.

I asked an friend for feedback on what I could change, and they told me: "Change the title to: “Between 2014 and 2018 Internet Crime Complaints Increase”.
Because this is no longer within the last 5 years." 

## Viz 2
Here I utilized stacked bar charts to show some of the changes in proportions between the number of victims in each age group, as well as the proportion of total loss for victims in each respective age group.

My feedback friend had this to say regarding this sketch: "When it says total loss, what is that loss? That’s a bit ambiguous. 
Explain what total loss is or use better unit labels." 


## Viz 3
For this wireframe, I began to input the data into Flourish as sketching the whole map would take to long. Flourish helped me to represent the data as a Choropleth Map.
This allowed me to show the data representing all of the States, with their appropriate "weight" of internet crime victims.

I received the following feedback for this redesign: "Its hard to see the difference between states, can you make their outlines stand out more?"


# Redesigns of Data Visualizations:

##  Data Visualization for "Between 2014 and 2018 Internet Crime Complaints Increase"
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5423022"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

While this redesign is rather simple, I think that it accomplishes the changes I wished to make. I think that the line chart portrays the trend up a bit better. Additionally, the narrow range on the Y axis make the differences from 2015 to 2017 a bit easier to see. Additionally, I chose a blue line here to match the aesthetic in the 2018 Crime Report. 

##  Data Visualization for "Internet Crime Victims are Older and Lose More (2018)"
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5422611"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

This redesign is unfortunately not a stacked bar chart, as Flourish made it easier for me to display the data as a "grid of pie charts". Hopefully, I will be able to utilize stacked bar charts to make proportion comparisons in the future as I believe that they are easier to compare the grids of pie charts. That said, I think that this visualization does still bring some weight to the proportions and helps bring the data table to life. Additionally, I think that the title represents the conclusions that are easily made from interpreting the visualization. 


##  Data Visualization for "Internet Crime Victims by State in 2018"

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-map" data-src="visualisation/5359949"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
This visualization was very similar to the wireframe above. However, I made the State borders stand out more and I decided to use a blue gradient as it matches with the theme coloring of the overall report. While I do not think that this visualization does anything revolutionary compared to the original chart, I think that the Choropleth Map is a bit more pleasing to look at and appears more accurate as it includes data for all of the States.
