# This is my data visualization for General Government Debt
I used a "grid of line charts" option here a it shows the government debt changes over time for each nation represented in the data set.

# This is a different data visualization utilizing the same data set
Here I used a "grid of column charts" option as it shows the same data, but more "fully" represents the government debt with columns. 

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5299761"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


I chose to try showing the data a bit differently by using the columns option, as I thought that it may look better than the line charts option.
